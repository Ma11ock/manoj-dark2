* A friendlier version of the greatest Emacs theme of all time.
This is a fork of [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/themes/manoj-dark-theme.el][Manoj Dark]], the greatest theme in all Emacs-dom.

This fork removed font boldness in some scenarios. This was done because
there appears to be a bug in the font libraries that Emacs uses where bold
is sometimes rendered too large. This slows down Emacs on older computers,
and it looks ugly.

* TODO
I will eventually get around to fixing manoj-dark's modeline.
