* A friendlier version of the greatest Emacs theme of all time.
This is a fork of [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/themes/manoj-dark-theme.el][/Manoj Dark/]], the greatest theme in all Emacs-dom.
There are two flaws that this fork aims to address. 


The first is that Manoj-dark resizes the font in function names. 
This slows down Emacs on older computers as it stutters whenever a
function name is added 

The second problem with Manoj-dark is the mode-line. It's hideously ugly 
and is probably the main reason people switch to other high-contrast fonts.

* TODO
Currently, the mode-line fix has not been implemented.
